```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

Read in shapefile for oilspill events:

```{r}
oilspill <- read_sf(here("_posts", "2021-02-24-oilspill", "oil_spill","Oil_Spill_Incident_Tracking_%5Bds394%5D.shp"))
```

Read in shapefile for borders of California counties:

```{r}
ca_counties <- read_sf(here("_posts", "2021-02-24-oilspill","ca_counties","CA_Counties_TIGER2016.shp")) %>% 
  select(NAME, ALAND) %>%
  rename(county_name = NAME, land_area = ALAND)
```



#### Part 1: 

Make an exploratory *interactive map in tmap* showing the location of oil spill events included in the data.


First, set the `tmap` mode to "interactive viewing:"

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Set the viewing mode to "interactive":
tmap_mode(mode = "view")

```

Then, use `st_as_sf()` to convert latitude & longitude to spatial coordinates.

`4326` is the coordinate refernce system (CRS)

```{r}
oilspill_sp <- oilspill %>% 
  drop_na(LONGITUDE, LATITUDE) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"))


st_crs(oilspill_sp) = 4326 #defines a coordinate reference system

```

View interactive map:

```{r}
tm_shape(oilspill_sp) + 
  tm_dots()
```

Here is the same map with added land area.

```{r}
tm_shape(ca_counties) +
 tm_fill("land_area", palette = "BuGn") +
 tm_shape(oilspill_sp) +
 tm_dots()
```


#### Part 2:

Make a *finalized* static chloropleth map in `ggplot` in which the fill color for each county depends on the *count* of *inland* oil spill events by county for the 2008 oil spill data. 

First, we wrangle!



Let's join the California counties and oilspill datasets.
```{r}
cm_oilspill <- ca_counties %>%
 st_join(oilspill)

```

Then, find the counts by county for *inland* oil spills.

```{r}
oilspill_counts <- cm_oilspill %>% 
  filter(INLANDMARI == "Inland") %>% 
  count(county_name)
```


Finally, plot the cloropleth using the number of records for oil spills as the fill color. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = oilspill_counts) +
 geom_sf(aes(fill = n), color = "white", size = 0.1) +
 scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("lightgray","blue","darkblue")) +
 theme_minimal() +
 labs(fill = "Number of Oil Spills")
```
