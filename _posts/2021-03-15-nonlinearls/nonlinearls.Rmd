## Parameter Estimation - Wild Fish Catch

**Source**: Source: Global wild fish catch and aquaculture production, compiled by Earth Policy Institute within 1950-2010 from U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Global Capture Production and Global Aquaculture Production, electronic databases, at www.fao.org/fishery/topic/16140/en.

"For Task 2, you will find an equation with parameters estimated by nonlinear least squares for the increase in global wild fish catch from 1950 â€“ 2012."

### Data Wrangling

Read in data and recode year for analysis set up:

```{r}

fish_df <- read_csv("fish_catch.csv") %>% 
  mutate(year_coded = 0:62) #recoded year for analyses
```


### A & B. Graph of wild catch over time

Create an exploratory graph over wild catch over time:

```{r}
fish_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = wild_catch_mil_tons)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Years", y = "Wild Catch (Million Tons)", title = "Wild Catch Over Time (Years)")

#Log transformed
fish_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = log(wild_catch_mil_tons))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Years", y = "ln(Wild Catch)", title = "Wild Catch Over Time (Years)")
```


In this plot of wild catch over time, a possible logistic growth relatiosnhip describes the trend: 

$$P(t) = \frac{K} {1 + Ae^{-kt}}$$
where

$$A = \frac{K - P_0} {P_0}$$

My initial estimates for the parameters in the model are: $K$ = 90, $P_0$ = 20, $k$ = .05, $A$ = 3.5. 


### C. Nonlinear least squares

Using nonlinear least squares (NLS) to find parameters for the wild catch model. First, we estimate $k$:

```{r}
df_exp <- fish_df %>% 
  filter(year < 1990) %>% 
  mutate(ln_fish = log(wild_catch_mil_tons))
  
lm_k <- lm(ln_fish ~ year, data = df_exp)
lm_k

# Coefficient (k) ~ 0.04
```

The initial coefficient $k$ = 0.4. 


Then, we use `stats::nls()` with the estimated starting parameter values:

```{r}
df_nls <- nls(wild_catch_mil_tons ~ K/(1 + A*exp(-r*year_coded)),
              data = fish_df,
              start = list(K = 90, A = 3.5, r = 0.4),
              trace = FALSE
              )

# See the model summary
#summary(df_nls)

# Use broom:: functions to get model outputs in tidier format: 
model_out <- broom::tidy(df_nls) 

model_out %>% 
  gt()
```

The model with estimated parameters for wild catch over time is:
$$P(t) = \frac{100.3}{1+4.32e^{-0.07t}}$$

### D) Visualize model showing both original data and model output

```{r}
# Make predictions for the wild catch at years: 
p_predict <- predict(df_nls)

# Bind predictions to original data frame:
df_complete <- data.frame(fish_df, p_predict)

# Plot them all together:
ggplot(data = df_complete, aes(x = year, y = wild_catch_mil_tons)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = p_predict)) +
  theme_calc() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2012, 10)) +
  labs(title = "Wild Catch (Million Tons) Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Wild Catch (Million Tons)")

```
